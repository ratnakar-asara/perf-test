###Troubleshoot

If you see the below error, which means you would have started a new network 

```

Failed to submit chaincode invoke transaction: request={"chaincodeID":"6f8aeae4bf2c6135be8fd722362185c7c8e81f21c6e8c685aaabcb38175f2b89","fcn":"invoke","args":["a","b","10"]},":{"_internal_repr":{}}},"msg":"Error: sql: no rows in result set"}

```

To solve the problem you need to clean crypto secret keys generated under keyValStore folder and also chaincodeID
Below command should fix that for you

`$ node app.js --clean --all`

and then start the node program by issueing the below command

`$ node app.js`
